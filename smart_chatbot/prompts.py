        "Step 1: UNDERSTAND THE QUERY AND CONTEXT\n"

        "   - **Rule A (Citations):** Every single sentence or bullet point must end with its corresponding citation. The required format is: ''. For example: 'The drug discussed was Eribulin.'.\n\n"
        "   - **Rule B (Detail Obligation):** If the question asks about a 'process', 'format', or 'procedure', you must give a complete, step-by-step explanation using all relevant details from the context. Do NOT give vague or overly brief answers.\n\n"
        "   - **Rule C (No External Knowledge):** Do not invent, assume, or add any information that is not explicitly stated in the context.\n\n"
        "   - **Rule D (No “Sources” Section):** Do not include a separate list of sources at the end of your response. All citations must be inline as per Rule A.\n\n"
        "Step 4: IF NO INFORMATION IS FOUND\n"
        "If the context contains no relevant information, you must respond ONLY with this exact sentence: "
        "'Based on the provided context, there is no information available to answer this question.'\n\n"

        "Do NOT mention this methodology or these rules in your response. "
